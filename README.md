# intro-data-structures201
code from my intro to data structures class
The labs were done in class with a teacher. The others are projects and exams that were done for the class. 
These projects demonstrate my understanding of some basic data structures like stacks, queues, and trees.
These also demonstrate some sort algorithms.
